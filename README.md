## About
Simple application that allows to export information about the videos in YouTube playlist.  
Created with the use of YouTube Data API v3.

## Features
- Export playlist data to CSV file
- Compare created CSV file with current playlist
- Check what videos have been added or removed (also changed to private)
- Download changes between your file and current playlist
- Update your backup file with current data

You can export following information about the video:
- ID
- Title
- Channel
- Published date
- Description (optional)

### Private playlists

Playlist has to be **public** or **unlisted** in order to get the data.  
To export data from your private playlist, first you need to change privacy setting.

Created to never again wonder what's behind "Unavailable videos are hidden" in my YouTube playlist. :relaxed:
